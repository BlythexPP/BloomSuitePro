Welcome to the **Professional Bloom Filter Suite**, an advanced, yet user-friendly toolkit for creating and analyzing Bloom filters. This application blends professional-grade features with a modern GUI, empowering you to handle large data sets with minimal false positives.

## Key Features

- **Bloom Filter Creation**:  
  Easily transform `.txt` files into `.bf` Bloom filter files.  
  - Preprocess large inputs by:
    - Removing unwanted prefixes (BTC/ETH-specific).
    - Stripping balances/extra data.
    - Eliminating empty lines.
  - Set **extremely small error rates** (e.g., `0.00000000000001`) for near-flawless accuracy.
  - Coin-specific logic:
    - **BTC**: Define any prefix (like `bc1`, `1`, `3`) to filter out addresses.
    - **ETH**: Automatically remove the `0x` prefix from addresses.

- **Bloom Filter Analysis**:  
  Load `.bf` files and inspect:
  - **Parameters** (m, k, n, error rate)
  - **Hex Dump** of the internal bit array
  - **ASCII Preview**
  - **Header Interpretation**
  - **Comprehensive Statistics**: Check bit density, active bits, and element count for insights into filter efficiency.

- **Modern GUI & UX**:  
  - Intuitive **Tkinter** interface.
  - Organized tabs: **Analyze**, **Create**, and **Help**.
  - Quick navigation, responsive controls, and a clean aesthetic.


## Why Bloom Filters?

Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures ideal for memory-efficient membership tests. They provide rapid lookups and tunable false-positive rates, making them perfect for large datasets requiring space efficiency and speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies required)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Professional-Bloom-Filter-Suite.git
cd Professional-Bloom-Filter-Suite
python3 main.py
```

## Creating a Bloom Filter
1. **Prepare a .txt file**  
   - Include the elements you want to add to the Bloom filter.

2. **Navigate to the Create tab**  
   - Choose between **BTC** or **ETH** mode.
   - For BTC:
     - Define prefixes to remove.
   - For ETH:
     - Rely on automatic **0x** removal.

3. **Data Cleanup Options**  
   - Strip balances or extra data as needed.
   - Remove empty lines for cleaner input.

4. **Set the error rate**  
   - Define a very low error rate for optimal results.

5. **Generate the Bloom Filter**  
   - Click **Create Bloom Filter** to complete the process.

## Analyzing a Bloom Filter
1. **Navigate to the Analyze tab**  
   - Select a `.bf` file to begin analysis.

2. **Analysis Options**  
   - View hex dumps for detailed inspection.
   - Preview ASCII content for readability.
   - Interpret headers for metadata insights.
   - Display statistical information about the filter.
