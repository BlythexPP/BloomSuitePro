Welcome to the **Professional Bloom Filter Suite**, an advanced, yet user-friendly toolkit for creating and analyzing Bloom filters. This application blends professional-grade features with a modern GUI, empowering you to handle large data sets with minimal false positives.

## Key Features

- **Bloom Filter Creation**:  
  Easily transform `.txt` files into `.bf` Bloom filter files.  
  - Preprocess large inputs by:
    - Removing unwanted prefixes (BTC/ETH-specific).
    - Stripping balances/extra data.
    - Eliminating empty lines.
  - Set **extremely small error rates** (e.g., `0.00000000000001`) for near-flawless accuracy.
  - Coin-specific logic:
    - **BTC**: Define any prefix (like `bc1`, `1`, `3`) to filter out addresses.
    - **ETH**: Automatically remove the `0x` prefix from addresses.

- **Bloom Filter Analysis**:  
  Load `.bf` files and inspect:
  - **Parameters** (m, k, n, error rate)
  - **Hex Dump** of the internal bit array
  - **ASCII Preview**
  - **Header Interpretation**
  - **Comprehensive Statistics**: Check bit density, active bits, and element count for insights into filter efficiency.

- **Modern GUI & UX**:  
  - Intuitive **Tkinter** interface.
  - Organized tabs: **Analyze**, **Create**, and **Help**.
  - Quick navigation, responsive controls, and a clean aesthetic.

## Why Bloom Filters?

Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures ideal for memory-efficient membership tests. They provide rapid lookups and tunable false-positive rates, making them perfect for large datasets requiring space efficiency and speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies required)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Professional-Bloom-Filter-Suite.git
cd Professional-Bloom-Filter-Suite
python3 main.py
Usage
Analyze Tab:
Select a .bf file, explore its properties, view hex dumps, ASCII previews, interpret headers, and check statistics.

Create Tab:
Choose a .txt file, configure preprocessing (coin type, prefixes, strip balances, remove empty lines), set the error rate, and generate a new Bloom filter with a single click.

Help Tab:
Comprehensive guidance on features, usage tips, and links to advanced resources.

Your contributions help maintain and enhance this suite, ensuring continuous improvements and professional-grade functionality.

Example Workflow
Prepare a .txt file with elements or addresses.
In the Create tab:
Select coin type (BTC or ETH).
Define prefixes to remove for BTC or rely on 0x removal for ETH.
Remove empty lines and strip balances if needed.
Specify an ultra-low error rate.
Click "Create Bloom Filter".
Switch to the Analyze tab:
Load the newly created .bf file.
Inspect parameters, stats, hex dumps, and more.
