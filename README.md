Welcome to the **Professional Bloom Filter Suite**, a sophisticated and user-friendly tool designed for both novices and experts. It enables you to **create**, **analyze**, and **inspect** Bloom filters through an interactive graphical interface.

## Key Features

- **Bloom Filter Creation**:  
  Transform `.txt` files into efficient Bloom filters with just a few clicks.  
  - Preprocess large input files by removing unwanted prefixes (BTC/ETH-specific), stripping balances, and eliminating empty lines.  
  - Configure **extremely small error rates** (e.g., `0.00000000000001`) to achieve minimal false positives.
  - Supports both **BTC** and **ETH** modes:
    - **BTC**: Specify any prefix to remove from addresses.
    - **ETH**: Automatically remove `0x` prefixes from addresses.

- **Bloom Filter Analysis**:  
  Load existing `.bf` files and examine:
  - **Parameters**: Size (m), number of hash functions (k), number of inserted elements (n), error rate.
  - **Hex Dump**: View the internal bit array in hex form.
  - **ASCII Preview**: Get a quick ASCII representation of the filter data.
  - **Header Interpretation**: Understand the filter’s internal structure.
  - **Statistics**: Check the number of active bits, density, and inserted elements to gauge efficiency and usage.

- **Modern GUI**:  
  - A sleek, thematically consistent **Tkinter**-based interface.
  - Easy navigation via tabs: **Analyze**, **Create**, and **Help**.
  - Responsive controls, user-friendly dialogs, and a clutter-free layout.

## Why Bloom Filters?

Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that provide memory-efficient membership testing with a tunable false-positive rate. They’re perfect for large datasets where fast lookups and space efficiency are crucial.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed.
- Dependencies:
  - `tkinter` (usually included with Python installations).
  - No external libraries required.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Professional-Bloom-Filter-Suite.git
